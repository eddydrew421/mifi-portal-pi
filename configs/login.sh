# Note1: As this script runs on the openNDS router and creates its own log file, there is little point also enabling Binauth.

# Note2: Spaces will be translated to underscore characters.

# Hints:
# The output of this script will be served by openNDS built in web server (MHD) and
# ultimately displayed on the client device screen via the CPD process on that device.
#
# It should be noted when designing a custom splash page that for security reasons
# most client device CPD implementations MAY do one or all of the following:
#
#	1.Immediately close the browser when the client has authenticated.
#	2.Prohibit the use of href links.
#	3.Prohibit downloading of external files (including .css and .js, even if they are allowed in NDS firewall settings).
#	4.Prohibit the execution of javascript.
